"""Guard: no stray pre-rename ``malinche`` references leak back into src/.

The project was renamed Malinche→Timshel. A blanket sweep converted every
user-visible string, path, class and marker. A handful of references are kept
*deliberately* — migration code that must recognise the old names, external
identifiers, and a back-compat digest marker — enumerated in ``_ALLOWLIST``.
Any NEW occurrence outside that set is almost certainly an oversight and fails
this test, so the rename cannot silently regress.
